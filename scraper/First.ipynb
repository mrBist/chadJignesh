But if you\\'re serious about it, you can\\'t do it without widespread testing,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a city hall briefing Monday.

Of those, nearly 189,000 had tested positive. Because of rationing, just 44 per cent\\xa0of tests conducted in the state have been done in New York City, even though the city represents 74 per cent\\xa0of the state\\'s fatalities from the virus. Lack of testing capability, partly due to rationing of personal protective equipment for the people who would have to administer them, has also stopped officials from doing widespread testing of hospital and nursing-home staff who might be passing infections to each other and to patients.

Andrew Cuomo Cuomo said nearly 2,000 people were newly hospitalized with the virus Sunday, though once discharges and deaths are accounted for, the number of people hospitalized has flattened to just under 19,000. The governor said the state\\'s tenuous progress will likely continue as long as people continue to follow stay-at-home restrictions. \"The worst can be over, and it is over unless we do something reckless,\" Cuomo said. \"And you can turn those numbers on two or three days of reckless behaviour.\"'}\n"

This is our daily news roundup\\xa0with everything you need to know in one concise read. Sign up here to get this delivered to your inbox every morning. Will it really take \\'weeks\\' to ease physical distancing? Maybe not With increasing evidence that Canada is flattening its\\xa0COVID-19 curve, the next challenge is when and how to begin easing the country\\'s physical distancing rules. Take it slow and steady, say\\xa0some experts, who note\\xa0that it might be possible to start the easing sooner than you think.  There might well have been collective discouragement when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday that our isolation must continue for \"weeks.\"\\xa0But will it really take that long? It\\'s a debate that is just beginning, with some pushing for faster easing and others — especially those on the front lines in hospitals — begging for more time. Watch |\\xa0How to physical distance in tricky situations  \\xa0 \"I believe we\\'re at the peak but not through the peak,\"\\xa0said Dr. MIchael Gardam, an infectious disease specialist and veteran of the SARS epidemic and H1N1 influenza pandemic. He has been bracing for the COVID-19 surge for months as chief of staff at Humber River Hospital in Toronto. \"I thought it would be much worse. I was thinking about battlefield triage and who would get ventilators.\"\\xa0  Gardam is not expecting Canada to face the nightmare scenarios of New York City and northern Italy,\\xa0\"as long as we keep being intelligent and keeping a lid on things.\"  Opening up health care depends on a steady supply of protective equipment.\\xa0So far, Dr. Matthew Muller, the medical director of infection prevention and control at St Michael\\'s Hospital in Toronto, is not confident that support is in place. \"We\\'ve already depleted a lot of our supplies that have not been replenished yet, so there\\'s a number of pieces to the puzzle,\" he said.  As CBC\\'s Kelly Crowe writes, the bottom line is that physical distancing was never intended to prevent people from catching COVID-19.\\xa0The goal was to keep everybody from getting sick at once.  \"We want the epidemic to simmer, not to boil.\\xa0The cases are going to happen, but if they happen at a simmer, we\\'ll be able to handle them,\" said Gardam, noting that discussions of how to begin easing up have already started.\\xa0Read more on this story here. Checking on family  (Christinne Muschi/Reuters) Pierre Boule and his brother Sylvain look in a window to see their 96-year-old mother, Georgette Larame, yesterday at Centre d\\'hebergement Yvon-Brunet, a seniors\\' long-term care centre, in Montreal. In brief Oversight of infection control measures — key to keeping long-term care homes free of illness — plummeted when Ontario scaled back comprehensive annual inspections last year,\\xa0a CBC News investigation has found. Infection control violations would typically be caught during so-called resident quality inspections (RQIs), but CBC News found that the number of violations dropped off along with the number of inspections in 2019.\\xa0Read more about the drop in infection control oversight here. Watch |\\xa0Comprehensive long-term care inspections found critical shortcomings before they were cancelled  With most shelters full and operating at a lowered capacity to adhere to physical distancing rules, some cities, such as Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto, are putting up the homeless in hotels.\\xa0But advocates say there are too few beds and not enough being done.\\xa0The executive director for the Native Women\\'s Shelter in Montreal says she\\'s frustrated that the homeless are being left out in the cold — figuratively and literally — during this pandemic.\\xa0Read more about advocates urging\\xa0governments to provide more shelters and amenities for the homeless amid the pandemic. \\xa0 At least 50 per cent more people died in China\\'s virus epicentre of Wuhan than previously counted, with state media on Friday attributing the initial undercount to how overwhelmed the health system was coping with thousands of sick patients. The addition of 1,290 victims raised Wuhan\\'s death toll to 3,869, the most in China, and may confirm suspicions that far more people died in the city where the illness began than has been previously announced.\\xa0Read more on the revised death toll in Wuhan here.  Fans around the world — and now two members of the U.S. Congress — are demanding Live Nation, the world\\'s largest entertainment company, refund tickets for all events cancelled or postponed by the COVID-19 crisis.\\xa0The company, which owns Ticketmaster and took in $11 billion US in concert and ticket revenue last year, is under pressure from customers to return their money immediately. The company announced this week that while it honours refunds for shows that have been officially cancelled, 90 per cent of its shows are simply being postponed for future dates that have yet to be set. That means it won\\'t reimburse most of its customers right now as it awaits an end to the pandemic in the hope of one day rescheduling events.\\xa0Read how the pandemic has left Live Nation scrambling for cash.  Just days after saying he had total authority to reopen states, U.S. President Donald Trump yesterday sounded more deferential as he released a set of guidelines and said governors could \"call their own shots.\"\\xa0But with legal authority and public support already on their side, Trump\\'s reversal changes little. Before Trump\\'s pivot, states were already well ahead in the discussion of what comes next. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said he would begin slowly reopening on May 1, when current shutdown orders expire. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, on the other hand, extended his state\\'s stay-at-home orders until May 15.\\xa0Read more about the reopening debate in the United States.\\xa0 Watch |\\xa0Some states extend COVID-19 restrictions, Trump reveals reopening plan  One of the world\\'s foremost critical care experts is warning against what he calls the misuse and overuse of mechanical ventilators.\\xa0\"A standard treatment cannot be applied to an un-standard disease,\" said Luciano Gattinoni, a world-renowned Italian intensive care specialist. He was referring to the current protocol for the machines used to push oxygen into the lungs of patients gravely ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Gattinoni gained renown in the early 1980s for placing patients with certain respiratory problems in prone position, on their stomachs, to improve their oxygenation.

That\\'s where brothers Andy and Kirk Thomson, who own Can-Am RV Centre, came into the picture. Allen called Kirk about renting an RV. Two days later, he was backing one into her driveway. There was only one problem: he wouldn\\'t take payment at all. \"He said \\'Oh no, this is the least I could do.\\'\" Andy said his family felt compelled to help after seeing stories about front-line health-care workers treating COVID-19 patients while putting themselves, and their families, at risk of infection.

CBC EXPLAINS | Understanding COVID-19 testing in Ottawa  If you meet some of the criteria but don\\'t have symptoms, you won\\'t be tested\\xa0and should self-isolate for 14 days. If you have severe symptoms, call 911.

As of Friday morning, five Montreal firefighters had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. They\\xa0worked at stations in Westmount, Ahuntsic and Parc-Extension. They are now in self-isolation, along with 35 other firefighters who were in direct contact with them. \"The isolation of certain firefighters was also necessary after a cardiac emergency intervention for a citizen that, in all likelihood, was infected by the coronavirus,\" Chris Ross, president of the Montreal Firefighters Association, said in a news release Friday.

(Simon-Marc Charron/Radio-Canada) Because of these cases, Montreal\\'s fire department and the\\xa0union representing firefighters have reached an\\xa0agreement in principle to make temporary changes to the way the fire stations operate and firefighters\\' daily activities. The temporary changes include putting firefighters on 24-hour shifts, as of Monday, as well as changes in the way firefighters respond to calls. Ross said his members didn\\'t agree unanimously to the changes, but the union agreed they were necessary for everyone\\'s safety. The main objective of the changes is to ensure\\xa0firefighters\\xa0stay healthy,\\xa0thereby\\xa0maintaining front-line services — and preventing a domino effect, as more firefighters get sick or need to be isolated. Apart from the 24-hours shifts, all vacation time, time off and \"time swaps\" will be suspended until at least June 30, with the possibility of that being extended. Firefighters will not be transferred from one station to another, to eliminate the possibility of cross-infection between stations. When it comes to emergency first responder calls, firefighters will only respond to the most critical, until further notice.'}\n"

       "    'text': 'The latest:  Death toll reaches1,367, up 254 from the previous day. Apparent spike in cases and death toll relates to new method of diagnosis for COVID-19. China has worked through backlog of cases from earlier in the outbreak, some now clinically confirmed positive. China now has59,805 laboratory and clinically confirmed cases, up15,152. Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan, is largest cluster outside of China. 12 Canadians who were aboardhave the illness. No additional countries are reporting cases.   A new method of diagnosing the illness caused by novel coronavirusis allowing front-line medical workers in China to get patientsinto care more quickly andpublic health departments to then track down people who may have come into contact with the virus. At a World Health Organization newsconference Thursday, Dr. Mike Ryan,executive director ofWHO\\'s emergency program, explained an apparent spike in deaths and new cases reported by Chinese authorities. China now has 59,805 confirmed cases, up 15,152 from Wednesday, and the number of deaths increased by 254 to reach 1,367. The increase comes after many suspect cases from Hubei province that had been backlogged werereclassified using patients\\' chest images, rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation, said Ryan. So, the increase is largely due to a change in how cases are being diagnosedand reported,he said. A mother and toddler wear masks and plastic rain coats in an attempt to protect from exposure to the novel coronavirus at the Shanghai railway station on Thursday. (Aly Song/Reuters) \"Crucially, we understand that most of these cases relate to a period going back over days and weeks and are retrospectively reported as cases, sometimes back to the beginning of the outbreak itself,\" he said. \"We\\'ve seen this spike in the number of cases reported in China, but this does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak.\" The number of countries reporting cases of the illness has held steady at 24. Higher numbers may contain some good news Medical expertssay the higher numberslikely reflect a more accurate picture of the illness. Dr. Mike Tildesley, an associate professor at the University of Warwick in the U.K. who studies zoonoticdiseases — those that spread from animals to humans — said many of these new cases werepreviously defined as \"probable\" cases. \"Given this change in classification, it is unsurprising that we have seen an increase in confirmed cases, but this does not necessarily mean that we are seeing an increase in the rate of infection,\" he said in a written statement. \"What it does mean is that we may now have a more accurate measure of the true extent of the outbreak, which in the longer term will improve our ability to predict how the virus may spread in the future.\" Indeed, cases are not rising dramatically outside China apart from among passengers on a cruise liner now quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama,said Ryan. 12 Canadians test positive on cruise ship A further 44 cases were reported on the vessel Thursday, raising the total to 219. Authorities said some elderly people would finally to be allowed to disembark on Friday. Foreign Affairs MinisterFrançois-Philippe Champagnesaid12 Canadians who were aboard the ship have contracted COVID-19. Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne says 12 Canadians aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship have contracted the virus. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) They\\'ve sincebeen moved to Japanese health facilities, and at least three require hospitalization, he said. Champagne said emergency response teams and consular officials are in Japan to make sure Canadians are receiving the help they need. \"We know that there are some people who need medications on board, they want to have contact with their families, we\\'re facilitating that,\" Champagne said at a briefing in Senegal, where he is on a diplomatic trip. Passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship continue to be quarantined at Daikoku Pier Cruise Terminal in Yokohama, south of Tokyo.  (Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters) As for Canadians still in the centre of the viral outbreak, Champagne said all the 400 or so Canadians who wished to leave Hubei, the Chinese province that includes the city of Wuhan, have been repatriated and are quarantined in southern Ontario, at Canadian Forces Base Trenton. The last flight chartered by the Canadian government to evacuate people from Wuhan, which landed at CFB Trenton on Tuesday, was the last the government plans to send to the region. Those Canadians who chose to stay behind in Hubei have been provided with consular services, Champagne said. Death toll steady around 2% Mark Fielder, a professor ofmedical microbiology atLondon\\'sKingston University, said the new clinically confirmed cases are now added to those previously identified only throughnucleic acid-based lab tests. \"I am reassured that despite the rise in numbers, the death rate still stands at around twoper cent,\" said Fielder.

       "    'text': 'At least 50 per cent more people died in China\\'s virus epicentre of Wuhan than previously counted, with state media on Friday attributing the initial undercount to how overwhelmed the health system was coping with thousands of sick patients. Wuhan, the capitalofHubei province, saw an addition of 1,290 victims Thatraisedits death toll to 3,869 — the most in China — and confirmedsuspicions that far more people died in the city where the illness began than has been previously announced. The total confirmed cases in the city of 11 million people also increased by 325 to 50,333, accounting for about two-thirds of China\\'s total 82,367 announced cases. The revised Wuhan figures raised China\\'s death toll to 4,632, up from 3,342 announced by the National Health Commission on Friday morning.  The official Xinhua News Agency quoted an unidentified official with Wuhan\\'s epidemic and prevention and control headquarters as saying that during the early stages of the outbreak, \"due to the insufficiency in admission and treatment capability, a few medical institutions failed to connect with the disease prevention and control system in time, while hospitals were overloaded and medics were overwhelmed with patients. \"As a result, belated, missed and mistaken reporting occurred,\" the official was quoted as saying.

The revised Wuhan figures, released Friday, raised China\\'s death toll to 4,632, up from 3,342. (STR/AFP via Getty Images) The new figures were compiled by comparing data from Wuhan\\'s epidemic prevention and control system, the city funeral service, the municipal hospital authority, and nucleic acid testing to \"remove double-counted cases and fill in missed cases,\" the official was quoted as saying. Deaths occurring outside hospitals had not been registered previously and some medical institutions had confirmed cases but reported them late or not at all, the official said. WHO under fire Questions have long swirled around the accuracy of China\\'s case reporting, with Wuhan in particular going several days in January without reporting new cases or deaths. That has led to accusations that Chinese officials were seeking to minimize the impact of the outbreak and wasting opportunities to bring it under control in a shorter time. A group of eight medical workers, including a doctor who later died of the virus, were even threatened by police for trying to alert people about the disease over social media. China didn\\'t warn public of likely pandemic for 6 crucial days Chinese officials have stridently denied covering up cases, saying their reports were accurate and timely. However, the U.N.\\'s World Health Organization has come under criticism for defending China\\'s handling of the outbreak and President Donald Trump is suspending funding to the WHO over what he alleges is its pro-China bias. Trump\\'s blaming of China came after he initially spent weeks showeringpraise on Chinese President Xi Jinping over the country\\'s performance in the pandemic, while largely dismissing the risk it posed to the U.S. INTERACTIVEAre Canada\\'s efforts to flatten the curve working?  At the start of the outbreak, China proceeded cautiously and largely in secret, emphasizing political stability and the leadership of Xi\\'s ruling Communist Party. More than 3,000 people had been infected before China\\'s government told the public that a pandemic was likely, something officials had concluded six days earlier. The risk of sustained human-to-human transmission was also downplayed, even while infected people entered hospitals across the country and the first case outside China was found, in Thailand. Officials even sought to shift blame to the U.S. for the outbreak, with foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian tweeting without evidence on March 12: \"It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan ... US owe us an explanation!\"'}}]}"

      "Five British nationals, including a nine-year-old child, have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in France, after staying in the same ski chalet and coming into contact with a person who had been in Singapore, Health Minister Agnès Buzyn said on Saturday. The total number of people infected with the virus in France has now reached 11. Buzyn said the group of people newly infected with the virus were not in a serious condition. They had formed \"a cluster, a grouping around one original case\" after staying in the same chalet, in the Contamines-Montjoie resort in Savoie in eastern France. \"That original case was brought to our attention last night, it is a British national who had returned from Singapore where he had stayed between January 20 and 23, and he arrived in France on January 24 for four days,\" Buzyn said. As China deaths hit 722, WHO warns of global shortage of coronavirus protective equipmentWhat we know so far about the coronavirus Two of the apartments in the ski chalet were being examined, another health official told the televised news conference. 2 schools closed The chalet where they were staying housed a British family that lives in Contamines and another family of British vacationers. The sickened child lives in Contamines and attends a local school, and took French classes at another local school, regional officials told a news conference Saturday. Both schools will be closed, and the pupils will be monitored for signs of the virus.  The infected Britons had been hospitalized overnight in the region, the ministry added. The virus has killed more than 720 people and infected over 34,500 since late December, mostly in China's Hubei province and elsewhere across mainland China.\n"

       "'The latest:  Worldwide COVID-19 death toll tops 100,000. U.S. sees more than 35,000 new cases and 2,108 deaths on Friday. Government documents reveal a slow start to Canada\\'s COVID-19 response. Canadian military intelligence unit issued warning about Wuhan outbreak back in January. Emergencies Act talks rejected by premiers, deemed a distraction. Health experts are calling for increased COVID-19 testing—so why isn\\'t Canada testing everyone? INTERACTIVE |Tracking the coronavirus in Canada.  The worldwide death toll from the coronavirus topped 100,000 on Friday, with the U.S. seeing more than 2,000 deaths in one day,according to the running tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. The sad milestone comes as Christians around the globe mark a Good Friday unlike any other —in front of computer screens instead of in church pews. Meanwhile, some countries are tiptoeing toward reopening segments of their battered economies. In Canada, a physician who tweeted about an elderly patient who chose to forgo a ventilator is now asking the government not to forget about community doctorsduring the pandemic. On Thursday, Dr. Nadia Alam of Georgetown, Ont., posted a tweet about a 72-year-old man with worsening COVID-19 symptoms she treated that day. Despite the fact that his condition was quickly worsening, Alam said, he did not want to be hooked up to the machine sometimes critical to keep COVID-19 patients alive. \"He turned to me and said \\'If I go, if I die from this, I would rather die looking at the sky. I would rather die looking at my family,\\'\" Alam told CBC\\'s RosemaryBarton in a Friday interview. I’m starving. Thirsty. Tired. I wore my N95 mask for 7 hours straight. Careful to conserve my <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PPE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PPE</a>.<br><br>Then I go see a 72 yr old man with poor lung function &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID%E3%83%BC19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVIDー19</a>, on oxygen.<br><br>“I don’t want to die on a machine. I want to see the blue sky.”<br><br>So I sat. And we watched the sky. <a href=\"https://t.co/jDoQpIpRwn\">pic.twitter.com/jDoQpIpRwn</a>&mdash;@DocSchmadia Instead,Alam sat with the man, and called his family. That tweet struck a chord with Canadians as it was shared widely online, but Alam saidthere is another pressing issue she would like addressed. While hospitals are already struggling with dangerously low supplies of personal protective equipment like gowns and masks, Alam saidmany family doctors have already run out completely. And while the government has launchedmeasures to supply hospitals, it\\'s important local doctors have the equipment they need as well. WATCH | Doctor talks about the \\'desperation, sadness and hope\\' around putting COVID-19 patients on life support Dr. Nadia Alam of Georgetown, Ont., describes how one elderly patient didn\\'t want to be on a ventilator and how her children are afraid that she, too, may get sick. 10:28 \"I know that you\\'re focused on the hospitals — please don\\'t forget about the communities,\" Alam said, \"because that is where we take care of our pregnant patients, that is where we take care of little kids, that is where I take care of my patients with heart failure and cancer, for pain control.\" Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister Trudeau addressed the issue of health-care workers contracting the virus, and the need for hospital workers to have personal protective equipment. He saidhealth workers need to know \"that we have their back\" and have the support they need. Other health workers have alreadyexpressed concern about shortages of the protective gear they need.  Thefts in hospitals lead to lock up of masks, protective gear amid COVID-19 supply shortage  The daily briefing outside Rideau Cottage also looked at financial assistance to businesses and the supply of personal protective equipment, but the prime minister also took questions about testing, saying that expanded testing will be a \"key part\" of the path forward. After facing calls for more data about what was driving decisions, Canadian federal health officials on Thursday presented modelling information on how the outbreak could unfold. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada\\'s chief public health officer, said that the models aren\\'t crystal balls — but they \"help us to plan and they tell us that our collective actions can have a direct and significant impact on the epidemic trajectory.\" WATCH | Trudeau lays groundwork for never-used Emergencies Act: Sources tell CBC News that the federal government has sent a letter to provinces and territories as part of the consultation period — a required step before triggering a public welfare emergency. 6:21 The models suggest that even with stringent public health measures, Canada could see 4,400 deaths linked to the growing epidemic. That figure — the most optimistic in the models presented — is just one of the projections offered by officials, who stressed that how people behave now will be critical to how the epidemic evolves. Health officials projected that 11,000 Canadians would die over the course of the pandemic if 2.5 per cent of the population was infected, a number that increased to 22,000 if the infection rate hit five per cent of the population. All the projections are \"highly sensitive\" to behaviours, Tam said as health officials outlined models with strict measures as well as offering a glimpse into what might have happened without controls.  Get the details of the models and projections and learn more about how to interpret COVID-19 disease models.  Public health officials have urged people to stay home, avoid large gatherings and keep up physical distancing, handwashing and other measures. Trudeau said that people generally come together at this time of year, \"but this weekend is going to be very different.\" Families and religious communities will need to find ways to connect despite physical separation. Even Easter egg hunts will be different, Trudeau said, as families stay home. WATCH | Public health officials want people to stay apart to slow the spread of COVID-19.Here\\'s a look at how to do that in some tricky situations:  Physical distancing has radically changed how we socialize. But there’s still some scenarios where it’s difficult to limit our physical contact with others. Here’s how to best navigate them. 3:23 His remarks came a day after he cautioned that public health measures won\\'t be lifted any time soon, a subject he returned to Friday. He said the government is talking with provinces, experts and industry about how and when restrictions might be lifted— but noted that Canada is still in the \"first phase\" of the spread of the virus. He said it\\'s possible Canada would be out of the first wave this summer, and at that point a loosening of some rules could occur. \"We\\'ll have to be very careful about how we do that,\" he said, noting that the country would still need to be vigilant about a resurgence of the virus. WHO cautions against easing movement restrictions Elsewhere, as weeks of lockdowns were extended in nation after nation, world governments were pressed to ease restrictions on key businesses and industries. After a two-week freeze on all non-essential economic activity, Spain decided to allow factories and construction sites to resume work on Monday, while schools, most shops and offices will remain closed. In Italy, the industrial lobbies in regions representing 45 per centof its economic output urged the government to ease its two-week lockdown on all non-essential manufacturing, saying the country \"risks definitively shutting down its own motor, and every day that passes the risk grows not to be able to restart it.\" The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that a premature lifting of restrictions could \"lead to a deadly resurgence.\" WATCH |WHO warns against lifting restrictions too quickly The World Health Organization says that lifting restrictionsprematurelyduringthe coronavirus pandemic could lead to a deadly resurgence of the virus. 1:35 He said there had been a \"welcome slowing\" of the epidemicinsome European countries —Italy, Germany, Spain and France —butthere had been an \"alarming acceleration\" elsewhere includingcommunity transmission in 16 countries of Africa. The novel coronavirus,known as SARS-CoV2,was first reported in China in late 2019. There is no known cure or vaccine for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. While most people who contract the illness will experience mild to moderate symptoms, health officials have cautioned that certain segments of the population, including the elderly and people with pre-existing health issues, face a higher risk of severe disease and death.   Canada lost more than 1 million jobs last month as COVID-19 struck   The Public Health Agency of Canada, which has been posting updated information about the virus, says that COVID-19 is a \"serious health threat.\" The agency says that risk varies between communities but notes that the overall risk to Canadians is \"considered high.\" Read on for a look at what\\'s happening in Canada and around the world.
